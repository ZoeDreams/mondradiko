When writing source code for Mondradiko, please follow the
[Google C++ Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html), and
run `cpplint` on all modified files to ensure conformance.

Before making any major changes, please raise an issue to discuss the planned
changes with the maintainers. When making a pull request, we may ask that you
make some changes to integrate better with the source, or to fix
formatting/style choices.

The best way to keep in touch with Mondradiko's development is to join
